## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, EJS, MongoDB
HTML and CSS are simple, but care had to be placed in ensuring the routes were properly annotated for the data to be sent to the database.

## Lessons Learned
Sometimes all it takes is for a simple small typo to ruin everything. The path/routes names are very sensitive and need to be properly put in. Failure to do so would send an error to the client device. It could also prevent any posting of data to the database.
